# Material 3 Theme for MUI

The code in this folder is taken directly from the
[`ZakAlbert/react-material-you-theme` repository on GitHub](https://github.com/ZakAlbert/react-material-you-theme). ~~All credits for this
module belong to the owner.~~ The module has been substantially modified. The code has been entirely changed and the only code remaining from the original project is parts of [`getThemedComponents.ts`](./getThemedComponents.ts), and even then, the styling has been substantially reworked.

The original source is at [this link](https://github.com/ZakAlbert/react-material-you-theme/tree/main/src/theme).
