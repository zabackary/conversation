# Material 3 Theme for MUI

The code in this folder is taken directly from the
`ZakAlbert/react-material-you-theme` repository on GitHub. All credits for this
module belong to the owner.

This folder is copied directly into the project to allow for customization and
becuase `react-material-you-theme` does not appear to be on NPM.

The original source is at [this link](https://github.com/ZakAlbert/react-material-you-theme/tree/main/src/theme).
